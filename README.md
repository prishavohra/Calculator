# Java Calculator

Welcome to my basic **Java Calculator** project! This program lets users perform simple mathematical operations with a clean console menu interface. It also handles edge cases using **exception handling** like a 

Project Structure

This project includes the following classes, each dedicated to a specific mathematical operation:

- `Addition.java` â€“ Adds two numbers
- `Subtraction.java` â€“ Subtracts one number from another
- `Multiplication.java` â€“ Multiplies two numbers
- `Division.java` â€“ Divides one number by another (handles division by zero)
- `Square.java` â€“ Calculates the square of a number
- `Cube.java` â€“ Calculates the cube of a number
- `SquareRoot.java` â€“ Computes the square root (handles negatives)
- `Main.java` â€“ Brings everything together with a menu-driven interface

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. Launches a console menu on startup.
2. User selects an operation from the list.
3. Inputs are taken via `Scanner`.
4. Relevant class method is invoked.
5. Displays the result, and loops until exit.

### Example Menu:
